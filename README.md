# Hey, I'm Chris but people call me `Dice` ðŸ˜†

Hi, I am Christopher Mwalimo. My main interests in tech are ML/AI, Data Science, Backend and Game Dev. Besides tech, I also like/love: gaming, football and reading articles and artbooks on the earth, sci-fi and anatomy.

- Currently studying Statistics and Comp. Science (in my final year).
- Learning new concepts everyday in the tools/languages/stacks I am using and interested in using in the future.
